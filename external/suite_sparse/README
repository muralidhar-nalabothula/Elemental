This folder contains Elemental's modifications of a subset of SuiteSparse. Said 
modifications retain the (non-viral) GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1, or (at your option) any later version.

In particular, modifications of the AMD and LDL modules have been included,
with an 'El' prefix to avoid conflicts with official versions of SuiteSparse.

Note that amd.f and amdbar.f were removed since they served only as a 
historical reference, and amd_global.c was removed since it was empty.
